            <h2>Introducing Checkviz</h2>
            <p>
                I worked on the Insight7 team as the lead product designer and this project/startup was aimed at
                creating a product that enables product teams analyse customer and user research as well as gather AI
                powered insights in order to build quality products that solve the needs of those customers. The main
                purpose of the project was to empower B2B companies with a tool that aggregates, analyses and activates
                customer feedback to drive revenue and retention. As the lead designer on the project, my role was
                started at owning the whole process end to end and to execute all stages of the design process, using my
                skills in conceptualizing, wire framing, prototyping, design systems, user interface, and user research.
                I collaborated with the engineering team to translate designs into incredible products, and created
                engaging UI designs, features, and interactions that addressed specific user needs.
            </p>

            <p class="mt">
                The design challenge was to create a user-friendly interface that would be accessible to a wide range of
                users, regardless of their level of customer data analysis knowledge. The solution needed to be
                intuitive and easy to use, while also offering advanced features for the average B2B product leader.

            <h2>Design Solution</h2>
            <p>
                The final design solution for Insight7 was a user-friendly platform that provided users an avenue to
                analyse customer feedback in a less tedious method, basically slashing 7 hours of work to 7 seconds. The
                platform was designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and modern user interface. The main
                features of the platform included a prioritization widget to help product owners automate their
                workflows, push tasks to Jira, monitor the status of those tasks whether pending, in progress or
                completed. It also included a project section for storing all their analysed data in a project form with
                an easy-to-understand high powered dashboard showing in depth themes and sentiment from their customer
                feedback. Furthermore, it included a library experience where you see all your files individually and
                you also get to analyse single one-on-one conversations to mine insights and extract painpoints, desires
                and behaviors. Another interesting feature included a data playground where users get jobs done for
                example, create affinity maps, generate roadmaps, generate opportunity solution trees etc
            </p>

            <p class="mt">
                As a designer on the project, I made several key design decisions to ensure that the platform met the
                needs of the target audience especially in my choice to use clear and concise language and copies to
                communicate effectively to the end user.
