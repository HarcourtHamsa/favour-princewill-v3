# Project: Portfolio

## How to: Add project description

- Enter `src` folder and create a new file with the name of the project. For example, `e-plaza.html`

- Enter the `webpack.config.js` file. On line 4, add the name of the file you created in the previous step. For example if the name of the file I created was `new-project.html`. Then:

```javascript
// webpack.config.js

const pageNames = ["experience", "e-plaza", "new-project"];
```

- Sync your changes by running `npm run dev` on your terminal.

If you don't know how to open terminal, here are the steps:

```
// windows
ctrl + `

// mac
cmd + j
```
